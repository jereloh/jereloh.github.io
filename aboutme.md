## My name is Jeremy Loh.

- I love thinkering with technology, I find myself breaking technology and fixing them all the time.
- This blog aims to share about the cookies I've baked, sharing my experience through my adventures being in I.T. I hope others find it easier to pick up I.T. after reading what I've shared here!

If it aint broke, brake it!
